The Portofolio project is an HTML and CSS website I created to house my work. The most recent version of th portfolio has been updated to include 3 of my recent projects and assignments. I also made some changes to links, images, and CSS to improve some of the functionality of the site. The page is reponsive and adjusts to mobile screen sizes.
